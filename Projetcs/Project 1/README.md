# Project 1
In this project, I have implemented a system using `Python` which is capable of hacking `Affine` and `Vigenere` encrypted ciphertexts without knowing anything about the keys.

## Hacking Affine:
* Brute-Force
* Detecting English Text

## Hacking Vigenere:
* Kasiski Examination
* Frequency Analysis
* Detecting English Text
