# Project 1
In this project, I have implemented a system using `Python` that is capable of hacking Affine and Vigenere encrypted cipher texts, without knowing anything about the keys.

## Hacking Affine:
* Brute-Force
* Detecting English Text

## Hacking Vigenere:
* Kasiski examination
* Frequency analysis
* Detecting English Text
